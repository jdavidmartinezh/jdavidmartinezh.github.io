          <p>
            I graduated from ITAM in Mexico City with a B.S. in Economics
            (research specialization) and an M.A. in Economic Theory, with core
            coursework in economics and computer science.

            Past experience includes serving as a Research Fellow at

            I am working toward a career at the intersection of economics and
            statistical decision theory. I am interested in applying my work
            to development and political economics scenarios. I currently work
            as a predoctoral research fellow at Harvard University for
            <a class="about-link" href="https://sites.google.com/view/ebreza/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emily Breza</a>

                We model how inherited coercive capacity shapes authoritarian responses to
                rising dissent. We employ novel data on repression to show that Mexican municipalities with stronger militia
                presence saw more repression and less land redistribution after mid-1960s social dissent
                shocks.

                  Why do authoritarian regimes exhibit subnational variation in their use
                  of repression versus redistribution to manage local dissent? We develop
                  a model in which an autocrat's localized response to dissent depends on
                  incomplete information about the geography of people's discontent and
                  the government's coercive capacity, a feature that authoritarian
                  governments often inherit from the past. The model predicts that when
                  dissent rises, rulers are more likely to rely on repression rather than
                  redistribution in areas with strong inherited coercive capacity. We then
                  test these predictions using novel data from twentieth-century Mexico
                  under PRI rule. Our empirical strategy exploits a sharp increase in
                  overall dissent in the mid-1960s and three sources of subnational
                  variation: (1) a large-scale land reform that redistributed over half of
                  all agricultural land between 1910 and 1992; (2) the localized presence
                  of regime-aligned rural militias with revolutionary origins; and (3)
                  newly digitized archival records documenting individual instances of
                  repression over time. Difference-in-Differences and Instrumental
                  Variable estimates indicate that after the sudden increase in dissent,
                  municipalities with a stronger militia presence experienced more
                  repression events and less land redistribution than areas with weaker or
                  no militia presence. Our findings demonstrate how historical variation
                  in inherited coercive capacity and informational frictions can shape the
                  subnational logic of authoritarian control.

                We exploit events that generated quasi-experimental variation in trust toward COVID-19 mRNA vaccines during the early vaccination campaigns in the Baltic region. We show that demographic groups historically targeted by Russian state influence operations experienced disproportionately lower vaccination uptake following these events. Combining quantitative estimates with qualitative evidence, we link this differential response to the presence and activity of Russian state propaganda and influence efforts in Europe.
